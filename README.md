## ⛏️ Set-up
### 🐳 Docker
Assuming you have docker installed, you can easily use docker to setup the vector server.

1. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull manansuri27/nanovector
   ```
   
2. Run the image now,
   ```bash
   docker run manansuri27/nanovector
   ```
The server will be running on `localhost:5000` now.

### 🐙 GitHub
Follow the steps below to setup the repository and run the server.

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MananSuri27/nanovector.git
   cd nanovector
   ```
